### As a final examination project, we were tasked to write a program to graphically represent the Mandelbrot set, applying the concepts that were taught us in both the coding and cloud coumputing lectures 

## Tasks:
- Writing a program that draws the Mandelbrot set and saves it as a _.png_ output
- Implementing parallel computing to achieve the same result
- Compare the performance 
- Uploading all the code on a Virtual Machine running on Googlge Cloud, to which the professors were granted access via SSH.  

## Content:
-**build-o/**: release build created via CMake
-**build-d/**: developer build created via CMake
-**main.cpp**: "standard" code to draw the Mandelbrot set
-**main_par.cpp**: parallel computing code to draw the Mandelbrot set
-**CMakeLists.txt**: CMake file used to compile the code
-**mandelbrot.png**: graphical representation of the Mandelbrot set produced as _.png_ output by _main_par.cpp_
