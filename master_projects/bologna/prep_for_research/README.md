### As final examination for the _Preparation for scientific research_ course I had to choose a topic, ideally one related to my Master's thesis, and show what conducting scientific research on it would look like.   
### The code used for this project was to be submitted, along with a short (1-2 pages) report.

## Description:
The preliminary idea for my Master's Thesis topic was to build an animal phantom to which anatomical changes could be applied and to measure/visualize those changes using Proton Radiography.    
For this project I chose to create a basic simulation of a proton radiography setup, with a proton beam irradiating an animal phantom, i.e. a simplified model of a rat skull, showing the potential steps with which the model could be improved upon.  

## Content:

-**Project.ipynb**: the notebook containig the code I used to create the simulation, showcasing all the different steps

-**Preparation_for_SR_Project**: the report I submitted for evaluation, explaining the project idea and showing the reasoning behind the decisions I took
