## Task:
For this project I had to choose a topic, ideally one related to my Master's thesis, in order to show what conducting scientific research on it would look like.  
I chose to create a basic simulation of a proton radiography setup, with a proton beam irradiating an animal phantom, i.e. a simplified model of a rat skull, showing the potential steps with which the model could be improved upon.  
The code used for this project was to be submitted, along with a short (max. 2 pages) report.

## Content:

-**Project.ipynb**: the notebook containig the code I used to create the simulation, showcasing all the different steps

-**Preparation_for_SR_Project**: the report I submitted for evaluation, explaining the project idea and showing the reasoning behind the decisions I took
