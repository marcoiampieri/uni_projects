#### Here are the main scripts I used to analyze the data I gathered to write my Master's Thesis, mostly consisting in the depth-dose curves of proton beams at different energies, as well as some CTs of 3D-printed phantoms I designeed.

## Summary
The goal of my Master's Thesis (titled _"Design and development of an animal phantom for proton therapy simulations and physical measurements"_) was to design and build an anatomically accurate phantom via 3D printing
and to check if small anatomical changes similar to those actually occurring in adaptive proton therapy could be measured with the available instrumentation.
## Structure:
-**data/**: this folder contains some simulated data, in the same format as what was actually used for the thesis

-**utils/**: this folder contains all the functions used to analyze both the CT scans (_CT_analysis.py_) and the data related to the proton range measurements (_my_analysis_functions.py_)

-**Notebooks/**: this folder contains some of the Jupyter Notebooks I used to analyze the data

-**Outputs/**: this folder contains a few of the plots produced in the notebooks
