#### Here are the main scripts I used to analyze the data I gathered to write my Master's Thesis, mostly consisting in the depth-dose curves of proton beams at different energies, as well as some CTs of 3D-printed phantoms I designeed.

## Structure:
-**data/**: this folder contains some simulated data, in the same format as what was actually used for the thesis

-**utils/**: this folder contains all the functions used to analyze both the CT scans (_CT_analysis.py_) and the data related to the proton range measurements (_my_analysis_functions.py_)

-**Notebooks/**: this folder contains some of the Jupyter Notebooks I used to analyze the data

-**Outputs/**: this folder contains a few of the plots produced in the notebooks
