### This folder contains some of the projects I worked on during my first semester in Dortmund (Sommersemester 2024)

## Projects:
-**ICeCube_data_analysis/**: for this project, a colleague of mine and I were tasked to train three different ML algorithms using a labeled dataset from the _IceCube_ experiment, in order to see which one
was the best at predicting whether the neutrinos detected by the experiment were cosmic neutrinos or not

-**Scintillating_Fibers_analysis/**: for this project, a colleague of mine and I performed lab measurements of the flux of photons of a scintillating fiber (one identical to the ones used in the 
different CERN experiments) and compared it to simulated data

-**Silicon_Strip_analysis/**: for this project, a colleague of mine and I performed lab measurements aimed to characterize a silicon strip detector (like those adopted in experiments like ATLAS), using
both a current generator and a radioactive isotope as signal sources
